# NoteChartBuilder

Unreal Engine 5 project to make note charts for my PS1 rhythm game.

Unreal is owned by Epic, but all of the code/scripting exclusive to this project is [licensed under MIT](License.txt).

Bambi.wav is available in the main BKBS repo and is not included in the MIT License.

# Controls
Pressing preview in Editor starts the song playing.
Arrow keys while the song is playing generate arrows [may not show up until next time you hit preview]
Spacebar pauses and selects the nearest note line
1-2-3-4 on the main keyboard add or remove notes on the selected line
While paused, Page Up and Page Down jump to nearest lines with notes on them
Z and X fast forward and reverse

99% of the code and comments are in BP_NoteChart, including the controls.
